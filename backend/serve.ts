// Production server for the built site. The TanStack Start build emits a portable
// fetch handler (dist/server/server.js) plus static client assets (dist/client);
// this wraps them in a Bun server on port 3000 — static files first, SSR for the
// rest. Run `bun run build` before starting. Restart it with `bun run publish`.
//
// WebSocket: the same Bun server also hosts the 1:1 chat socket at /api/ws.
// TanStack Start server functions are request/response and can't hold persistent
// sockets, so the chat WebSocket lives in src/ws/chat.ts and is wired here via
// Bun.serve's `websocket` option. TLS is terminated by the host reverse proxy.
//
// Starting a new instance supersedes the old one: it frees the port no matter
// which user owns the current server (provisioning starts it as `engine`; a team
// member's `bun run publish` runs as their own user), so publish never collides
// with an already-running server. Every sandbox user has passwordless sudo, so
// the takeover works across user boundaries.
